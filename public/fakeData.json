    "desc": "In 1984, The Karate Kid took American theaters by storm and a star was forever born. That star, my friends, was The Green Mound Juniper Bonsai. However, The Green Mound Juniper isn’t simply a remarkable actor; it’s also one the most popular and easiest to care for outdoor Bonsai there is. With a natural, easy movement to their trunks and its uniquely textured, beautiful green foliage, these trees will absolutely dazzle in any setting you place them in. The Juniper, perhaps more than any other species of tree, truly captures the essence of Bonsai. Though it’s strictly an outdoor tree, it’s incredibly forgiving and tolerant of a variety of conditions and should thrive regardless of its environment with proper care.",
